This my project about national parks of the outdoors and mountains. It shows the different types of mountains and parks you
can go to around the states to see which fits for you. The only interesting that I like about my page was the image i found that fits for my website.<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 12 15 38 PM" src="https://github.com/Aazaad06/Capstone2/assets/130569123/c46e1204-5806-4cef-af77-34c509c8b77d">
